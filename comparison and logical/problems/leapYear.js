/*
    The challenge is to write a program that works out whether a given year is a leap year.
    by printing "<year> is a leap year." or "<year> is not a leap year."

    where <year> is the value of the year variable.

    A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, 
    but not divisible by 100 
    unless it is also divisible by 400.

let year = 2020;
